        <h2>Standard Operating Procedures</h2>
        <div class="divhalf">

                <p style="margin-top:0px;">
                    I spent a large portion of my time this summer working on the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) utilized by the CEPS and CBS IT teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I began my job, there was an expressed concern about fractionalization in the documentation standards between the different CEPS and CBS teams. 
                    The Engineering SOPs were structured differently in both form and content from the Computer Science SOPs, which were structured different from the Biology SOPs, and so on. 
                    I was given the task of creating a unified template that all CEPS and CBS IT members could use with when creating new documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first began with the "look" of the template, using shapes, images, and text to craft new headers for each program with the appropriate branding.
                    I combatted bizarre glitches in MS Word whereby the layering of the banner's shapes, text, and images would shuffle unprompted. 
                    I fixed this by exporting high-resolution images of the banners, and inserting them where the aggregation of shape and image used to be. 
                    Upon realizing that the images would increase file size by an undesired amount, I enabled slight image compression in the document settings to reduce this. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then undertook the task of making the templates "fillable", such that one could download the template, safely fill in the required fields, and then submit, all without directly editing the document layout. 
                    Given the instruction of crafting the fillable forms natively inside Word, I researched the different tools extensively, reading documentation and watching videos explaining the use of Plain Text Content Controls, Rich Text Content Controls, Document Restrictions, Permissions, and a variety of related things. 
                    After realizing the immense neglect Microsoft had for its fillable forms features, and the financial unviability of paying for better alternatives, I began a months-long journey of loopholes and workarounds, trying to make it work. 
                    Unreachable Text Boxes in headers, format-diseased Style References, falsely-advertised "Rich Text" Content Controls that allowed no custom formatting or pasting of images within forms, unless by creating impractical editing restrictions that left ugly, gray highlighting over all forms. 
                    Hundreds of dead-end Microsoft forum posts that pointed out bugs and errors I myself was seeking to fix. 
                    Despite my dearest efforts, the fillable form project was deemed unsalvagable, and replaced with a familiar system of editing the Word file directly. At least we know now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After creating this new template based on a combination of the CS SOP template, the Eng SOP template, and professional online examples, I was tasked with migrating old existing SOPs into the new template. 
                    After completing this, I submitted the new SOPs, submitted my new templates for CEPS and CBS, and dusted off my hands.

        <h2>End User Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            The School of Engineering, despite being a single entity, has diverse and distinct programs. 
            Previously, the EUI (End User Instructions, documentation on how to use a product or service) for each sub-school (Systems Eng., Biological Eng., Comp Eng., etc.) were bundled under one template, and thus were not easy to differentiate. 
            Given the icons for each sub-school, I created personalized colour-coded EUI templates for each program. 
            My approach to this task was similar to the SOPs, in that I first created visually appealling header-banners with custom branding according to the program, but my apporach differed in that EUIs did not require the multitude of forms and attention to minor details seen in the SOPs.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Project Briefs</h2>
        <p>
            The project briefs were similar to the SOPs, without unified format. 
            However, the task of updating the briefs was as simple as inserting the banners with the appropriate CEPS/CBS/Program branding.
        </p>

        <h2>Writing Documentation</h2>
        <p>
            Occasionally, a third party (someone external to the CEPS IT team) would reach out, requiring new documentation to be written about a particular software or process. 
            My supervisor would forward it to me, and I would carefully craft the new Documentation. 
            I utilized the techniques mentioned in my Goals to ensure that I was doing everything ideally, and made sure upon submitting that both my supervisor and the third party were content.
            For example, I wrote documentation describing how one could create an account with VMware and install a specific version, carefully describing the steps and including screenshots with the highlighting of key details.
