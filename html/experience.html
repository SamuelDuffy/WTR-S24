        <h2>Standard Operating Procedures</h2>
        <div class="divhalf">
            <div class="divhalftext">
                <p style="margin-top:0px;">
                    I spent a large portion of my time this summer working on the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) utilized by the CEPS and CBS IT teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I started my job, there was a concern about inconsistent documentation standards across the different CEPS and CBS teams. 
                    The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) varied significantly in both structure and content among the different disciplines: the Engineering SOPs were different from those in Computer Science, which were also different from those in Biology, and so on. 
                    I was tasked with developing a unified template that all CEPS and CBS IT members could use when creating new documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started by focusing on the visual design of the template, using shapes, images, and text to create new headers for each program, incorporating the appropriate branding. 
                    However, I encountered issues in MS Word where the layers of shapes, text, and images in the banner would unexpectedly shift. 
                    To resolve this, I exported high-resolution images of the banners and inserted them in place of the layered elements. 
                    When I noticed that these images increased the file size more than desired, I enabled slight image compression in the document settings to reduce it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then took on the task of making the templates fillable, so users could download the template, fill in the required fields, and submit it—all without altering the document's layout. 
                    I was instructed to create these fillable forms directly in Word, so I extensively researched the available tools, including Plain Text Content Controls, Rich Text Content Controls, Document Restrictions, Permissions, and more.
                    However, I quickly realized that Microsoft had largely neglected its fillable forms features, and purchasing better alternatives wasn't financially viable. 
                    This led me on a months-long journey of discovering loopholes and workarounds to make it work. 
                    I faced numerous challenges, such as text boxes in headers that couldn't be accessed, formatting issues with Style References, and "Rich Text" Content Controls that didn't allow custom formatting or image pasting without impractical editing restrictions that left unattractive gray highlighting over all forms.
                    I also encountered hundreds of dead-end Microsoft forum posts addressing bugs and errors I was trying to fix. 
                    Despite my best efforts, the fillable form project was ultimately deemed unsalvageable, and we reverted to the familiar system of directly editing the Word file. At least we learned from the experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After developing a new template that combined elements from the CS and Engineering SOP templates, along with examples from professional sources, I was assigned to migrate the existing SOPs into this new template. 
                    Once I completed the migration, I submitted the updated SOPs and the new templates for both CEPS and CBS, completing the task.

        <h2>End User Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            The School of Engineering, though a single entity, includes a variety of distinct programs. 
            Previously, the End User Instructions (EUI) for each sub-school—such as Systems Engineering, Biological Engineering, and Computer Engineering—were all grouped under a single template, making them difficult to differentiate. 
            To address this, I created personalized, color-coded EUI templates for each program, using their specific icons. 
            My approach was similar to the SOPs in that I started by designing visually appealing header banners with custom branding for each program. 
            However, unlike the SOPs, the EUIs didn't require extensive forms or the same level of detailed attention.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Briefs</h2>
        <p>
            Similar to the SOPs, the CEPS project briefs had no standardized template. 
            To fix this, I created a project brief template for each of the CEPS sub-schools, following in the design pattern of the SOPs by creating unique banners with the respective logos and text. 
        </p>

        <h2>Writing Documentation</h2>
        <p>
            Occasionally, a third party—someone outside the CEPS IT team—would request new documentation for a specific software or process. 
            My supervisor would forward these requests to me, and I would carefully craft the required documentation. 
            I applied the techniques I mentioned in my goals to ensure everything was done optimally, and I made sure both my supervisor and the third party were satisfied with the final product. 
            For example, I created documentation that detailed how to create an account with VMware and install a specific version, clearly describing each step and including screenshots that highlighted key details.
