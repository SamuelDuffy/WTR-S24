        <h1>Purpose of this Page</h1>
        <p>This page will outline the work I did for this blah blah blah</p>

        <h2>SOPs</h2>
        <p>The college of engineering and physcial sciences, combined with the college of biological science, have long been disjoint in their documentation. A key example of this was their SOPs. I basically made a unified template yup.</p>
        <p>Issues: MS Word fucking sucks and cant piece together how to make a fillable forms</p>
        <p>Updated the eng ones with new template</p>

        <h2>EUI</h2>
        <p>The SOE had mix matched EUI so i made cool custom templates for all the diff engineering schools yayyyy</p>

        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>Project briefs needed updating for some reason.. yikes note to self finish this</p>
