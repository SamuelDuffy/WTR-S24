        <h1>Ok so bascially</h1>
        <p>
            After accomplishing the standardization of SOPs, my job became slightly Ad-Hoc, answering to problems as they arose. 
            After realizing this, I decided to put the time in-between the ad-hoc tasks to good use, studying a variety of academic and professional material that will help me in school and work. 
            This page will categorize the topics I studied during my free time.

                <h3>Linear Algebra</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Although taught during my first year, I never truly aquainted myself with Linear Algebra. 
                    The temporary professor responsible for teaching the course was nothing less than horrid, and a petition requesting their removal recieved more than 2/3rd's of the class's signature. 
                    I decided to give the subject another chance, and carefully watched and rewatched 3Blue1Brown's 16-video course on Linear algebra. 
                    After watching this course, and deeply researching any parts that didn't immediatly "click", I felt I had gained a true and deep intuition for all of the basics of Linear Algebra, inlcuding vectors, matrices, spans, dot and cross products, determinants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, change of base, and many other topics covered in the series. 
                    After I had established this base, I moved on to learning the slightly more advanced concepts such as Spectral Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition.

                <h3>Calculus</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    After the shocking ease with which I was able to pick up Linear Alegrba, I figured I would watch 3Blue1Brown's series on Calculus. 
                    I performed poorly in my Calculus class here at Guelph because it was my first semester and I had poor study habits. 
                    Regardless, I was always slightly insecure about my insufficient knowledge of Calculus, so I wanted to fix it. 
                    3Blue1Brown's Calculus series, combined with plenty of external resources and pondering revitalized my love of Calculus and made me truly grasp many concepts for the first time. 
                    The course deeply covered derivatives and many of their rules, integrals, the formal definition of the limit, higher order derivatives, integrals, and taylor series.

                <p>
                    I looked into the more mathematical aspects of machine learning such as gradient descent, vector embeddings, PCA, Lin. Reg. I'll write more about this l8r
