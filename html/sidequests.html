        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            After accomplishing the standardization of SOPs, my job became slightly ad hoc, answering to problems as they arose. 
            After realizing this, I decided to put the time in-between the ad hoc tasks to good use, studying a variety of academic and professional material that will help me in school and work. 
            This page will categorize the topics I studied during my free time.

        <h2>Math</h2>
        <p>
            This summer has given me a newfound love for Mathematics. 
            In-between my tasks I began researching mathematical topics that I found interesting or had trouble understanding with in the past. 
            After the culmination of my intermittent studies, I have decided to reorient my academic path to pursue a minor in Mathematics.

                <h3>Linear Algebra</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    During my first year, I had a rough introduction to Linear Algebra. 
                    The temporary professor who taught the course was so ineffective that more than two-thirds of the class signed a petition for their removal. 
                    Recently, I decided to revisit Linear Algebra and give it another shot. 
                    I carefully watched and rewatched 3Blue1Brown's 16-part series on the topic. 
                    I took the time to deeply research any concepts that didn't immediately click. Through this process, I developed a strong and intuitive understanding of the basics, including vectors, matrices, spans, dot and cross products, determinants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, change of basis, and more.
                    After establishing a solid foundation, I progressed to more advanced concepts, such as Spectral Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition.

                <h3>Calculus</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I struggled with Calculus during my first semester at Guelph, largely due to poor study habits. 
                    After experiencing how easily I could pick up Linear Algebra, I decided to watch 3Blue1Brown's series on Calculus. 
                    The series provided an in-depth exploration of derivatives and their rules, integrals, the formal definition of limits, higher-order derivatives, and Taylor series. 
                    By the end of the course, I felt I had gained a more intuitive understanding of these concepts. 
                    This newfound understanding, combined with additional resources and reflection (including re-reading my first-year calculus manual) reignited my love for Calculus.

                <h3>Machine Learning and Data Science</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Given how rapidly artificial intelligence is evolving and its significance in computer science, I wanted to develop a more technical understanding of how it works. 
                    I started by studying general data-driven techniques like Principal Component Analysis and Linear Regression — concepts I had briefly encountered in my Statistics class. 
                    After that, I moved on to methods more commonly revered in computer science circles, such as neural networks and the gradient descents and partial derivatives that drive these processes. 
                    Finally, I explored the operations behind transformers like GPT, including word embeddings, queries and keys, positional awareness, softmaxing, and much more. Through this journey, I feel I've gained a substantial amount of knowledge about this ever-changing field.

        <h2>Coding Problems</h2>
        <p>Learned about different coding patterns for solving problems. Patterns include Sliding Window, Two Pointer (regular and fast+slow), Merge Intervals, BFS, DFS, and Two Heaps.</p>

        <h2>Crash courses</h2>
        <p>In preparation for my next Coop Work Term in September, I did some crash courses and deep dives on the technology listed in the job posting. The technologies I investigated were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Angular</b>     - A TypeScript-based web application framwork.</li>
            <li><b>Redis</b>       - An in-memory key-value database/cache/message broker.</li>
            <li><b>PostgreSQL</b>  - A SQL-complient relational database.</li>
            <li><b>.NET</b>        - A software framework. Most known for it's language, C#.</li>
            <li><b>Docker</b>      - A virtualization platform for running software images.</li>
            <li><b>Kubernetes</b>  - A container orchestration system.</li>
