        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I had the pleasure of working as a CEPS Student IT Technician at the University of Guelph for the Summer of 2024. In this website I will go over details of my experience.</p>
        <p>On this page I will go over the general stuff i gotta talk about. On the <a href="html/experience.html">experience</a> page I talk about the specific problems I overcame, and on the <a href="html/sidequests.html">side quests</a> page I talk about the other interesting things I learned during my time here.</p>

        <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
        <p>My employer, the University of Guelph, needs no introduction.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals pertained to the skills required for good documentation. After my first tasks, I decided that good documentation could be achieved through the following three paths:</p>
        
        <div style="padding-left: 10px;">
            <h3>Content - Written Form</h3>
            <p>From previous examples, I realized that all good documentation strikes a balance between detail/specificity and conciseness/readability. I read over examples given to me by my supervisor, reputable online examples, and various other sources to try to "feel-out" the golden mean.</p>

            <h3>Style - Visual Form</h3>
            <p>The other "form" of documentation was its literal "look". Some documentation was segmented into spaced blocks representing "steps". Others structured as one continuous string of actions, letting the user simply follow along. Even seemingly minute details like bolding, font size, font, could greatly improve or impair the flow of the page.</p>
            
            <h3>Technique - MS Word</h3>
            <p>When I began to actually write and edit documentation, I realised that I was often halted by formatting. I knew that I needed to get good and learn shortcuts and shittttt</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I wasted my fucking time</p>
