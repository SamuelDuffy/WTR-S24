        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            I had the pleasure of working as a CEPS Student IT Technician at the University of Guelph for the Summer of 2024. 
            In this website I will go over my experience, reflect on my goals, and review the position.
            On this page I will fulfill the basic elements of a Work Term Report as listed in the guide. 
            On the <a href="html/experience.html">experience</a> page I will discuss the specific tasks I undertook and the problems I overcame, and on the <a href="html/sidequests.html">side quests</a> page I will talk about the other interesting things I learned during my time at this position.

                    I was employed by the University of Guelph, working under the CEPS IT team. The CEPS (College of Engineering and Physical Sciences) IT team is responsible for handling and maintaining the hardware, software, and account aspects of the College.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role pertained mostly to documentation. 
                    Rather than simply remembering the technical procedure for, say, how to set up a Simapro server, the CEPS IT team would instead create step-by-step instructions on how to set it up, keeping close attenion to detail and making careful note of lesser details such as required permissions, changes made to documentation, timestamps, and common errors or issues in the procedure.
                    Much of my work could be described simply as creating new documentation and modifiying existing documentation. The specifics can be found in <a href="html/experience.html">experience</a>.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            After being given my first tasks, I was able to clearly distinguish particular aspects of my documentation-writing process that could be improved on. 
            The three main aspects are listed as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div id="goals">
            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Quality of Writing - Content</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Having not written any documentation before, I knew I must create a set of general principles that would ensure my documentation could be quickly and simply understood by most university students. 
                    I looked online for reputable documentation sites to witness the writing-style of hardened documenteurs, in addition to examining existing CEPS documentation given to me by my supervisor. 
                    From these examples I realized that all good documentation strikes a balance between detail/specificity and conciseness/readability. 
                    Excessive or superfluous detail can make the reader feel patronized and sluggish, while a deficiency of detail can leave the user feeling confused and unhelped. 
                    Combining this insight with the basic principles of writing I had learned from essay-writing in english, philosphy, and anthropology classes, I carefully crafted my documents with the upmost attention. 
                    After completing my documentation, I would ask for feedback from my supervisor and other relevant parties, to see if any potential improvements had evaded my consideration.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Quality of Appearance - Style</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Aside from the actual words and sentences being used, another aspect that can aid documentation when done well, and hinder documentation when done poorly is the "look" of the overall documentation. 
                    In the process of examining online and CEPS examples, I made some observations about the visual layouts of different documentation. 
                    Some sites would physically space their steps out, putting emphasis on each individual step. 
                    Others would try to create a natural "flow" of steps, sacrificing distinctness of steps for overall visual cohesion. Verse versus Prose.
                    Some sites were lenient with imgagery, colour, and font, while others stuck with rigid, almost minimalist standards. 
                    With all this in mind, I designed my documentation in the image of those which I found most professional, readable, and endowed with the unmeasurable quality of "visual appeal". 
                    I rewarded bias also to the visuals of the existing CEPS documentation, as not to introduce needless change on the basis of my subjective sensibilities to a job that I will soon leave .

                <h3>Technique - MS Word</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    In the process of writing documentation, I realized that I was frequently impeded by my inability to use Microsoft Word efficiently. 
                    My words-per-minute was much lower than the speed at which I was thinking, and 
                    I was often using mouse-clicks and GUI for things that would be faster to do with keyboard shortcuts, such as text formatting, pasting raw text, and replacing words. 
                    By learning and applying techniques to fix these habits, I wished to eliminate Word as a limiting factor on my ability to write down my thoughts. 
                    My approach was to simply use Word as often as possible, which would increase my typing speed due to practice, and would also give rise to situations where I could practice shortcuts. 
                    I complimented this approach with the use of typing websites, which increased my words-per-minute drastically.

                    Overall, this job is a good exercise in understanding technical issues. 
                    It is one thing to be able to be able to set up a software/device, fix an account issue, or any like task, but to be able to concisely and articulately relay this process to another person in a manner that is void of confusion will solidify your knowledge of said task and process. 
                    For coders, writing technical documentation is an eye-opening experience that reminds you of the importance of conciseness and clarity. 
                    The visual consideration that goes into documentation will also give coders an "eye" for good design principles, which is so often lacked these days. 
                    Finally, while aquiring this job under exceptional circumstances may have played into this, this job granted me healthy free-time in-between tasks to tend to my academic and profesional inclinations.

        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to warmly thank Dr. Charlotte Yates for launching the President's Summer Co-op Initiative. 
            I at first felt cynically towards the program, seeing it as a means to boost low employment numbers among co-op students. 
            However this program has genuinely helped me avoid turmoil and the risk of losing co-op in a stressful and unpredictable market, and I offer my sincere gratitude to everyone involved in the program. 
            I would also like to thank my supervisor, Bogdan, for supporting me and giving me tasks when he found the chance, and I apologize for not bugging you more.
