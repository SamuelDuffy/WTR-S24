        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            I had the pleasure of working as a CEPS Student IT Technician at the University of Guelph for the Summer of 2024. 
            On this website I will recount my experience, reflect on my goals, and review the position in what will culminate as my Work Term Report.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this page I will fulfill the basic elements of a Work Term Report as listed in the guide, such as my goals, description of the job, and conclusions. 
            On the <a href="html/experience.html">experience</a> page I will recount the specific tasks I undertook and the problems I overcame, and on the <a href="html/sidequests.html">side quests</a> page I will talk about the other interesting things I learned during my time at this position.

                    I was employed by the University of Guelph, working under the CEPS IT team. 
                    The CEPS (College of Engineering and Physical Sciences) IT team is responsible for handling and maintaining the hardware, software, and account aspects of CEPS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role pertained mostly to documentation of internal processes. 
                    By documentation, I mean writing and modifying detailed technical instructions and processes that might be needed in the future. 
                    For example, instead of relying on memory for the technical steps to set up a Simapro server, the CEPS IT team creates step-by-step instructions for the setup. 
                    These instructions include detailed notes on required permissions, changes made to the documentation, timestamps of the changes, and common errors or issues encountered during the procedure.
                    For a more specific understanding of my work, see <a href="html/experience.html">experience</a>.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            After being given my first tasks, I was able to clearly distinguish particular aspects of my documentation-writing process that could be improved on. 
            The three main aspects are listed as follows:
        </p>
        
        <div id="goals">
            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Quality of Writing - Content</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Having never written documentation before, I needed to establish principles to ensure my work could be quickly and easily understood by university students.
                    I researched reputable documentation sites to observe the writing style of experienced documentarians and examined existing CEPS documentation provided by my supervisor. 
                    From these examples, I learned that good documentation strikes a balance between detail and conciseness. 
                    Too much detail can overwhelm and patronize the reader, while too little can leave them confused and unhelped.
                    By combining this insight with the basic writing principles I had learned from my English, philosophy, and anthropology classes, I meticulously crafted my documents. 
                    After completing my documentation, I sought feedback from my supervisor and other relevant parties to identify any potential improvements I might have missed.
                </p>

            <div class="goal">
                <h3>Quality of Appearance - Style</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Aside from the words and sentences used, the visual design of documentation can significantly impact its effectiveness. 
                    Good design can enhance documentation, while poor design can hinder it. 
                    In examining online and CEPS examples, I made several observations about different visual layouts. 
                    Some sites physically spaced out their steps to emphasize each one individually, while others created a natural flow of steps, sacrificing distinctness for overall visual cohesion. 
                    This contrast can be thought of as "verse versus prose." 
                    Some sites used plenty of imagery, color, and varied fonts, while others adhered to rigid, minimalist standards. 
                    With this in mind, I designed my documentation to mirror those examples I found most professional, readable, and visually appealing. 
                    I also aligned my visuals with the existing CEPS documentation to maintain consistency and avoid unnecessary changes based on my personal preferences, considering that I will eventually leave this role.

                <h3>Technique - MS Word</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    In the process of writing documentation, I realized that my inefficiency with Microsoft Word was frequently impeding my progress. 
                    My typing speed was much slower than my thinking speed, and I often relied on mouse clicks and the graphical user interface (GUI) for tasks that could be done faster with keyboard shortcuts, such as text formatting, pasting raw text, and replacing words.
                    To overcome this, I decided to improve my Word skills. 
                    My approach was to use Word as often as possible to increase my typing speed through practice and to create opportunities to learn and apply shortcuts. 
                    Additionally, I used typing websites to boost my words-per-minute rate significantly. 
                    By combining these methods, I aimed to eliminate Word as a limiting factor in my ability to document my thoughts efficiently.

                    Overall, this job has been a valuable exercise in understanding technical issues. 
                    It's one thing to set up software or a device, fix an account issue, or handle similar tasks. 
                    But to be able to concisely and clearly relay this process to someone else without causing confusion will solidify your understanding of the task and process.

                    For coders, writing technical documentation is an eye-opening experience that emphasizes the importance of conciseness and clarity. 
                    Moreover, the visual considerations involved in documentation also help coders develop an "eye" for good design principles, which is often lacking today.

                <p>
                    While acquiring this job under exceptional circumstances may have contributed to this, the position has provided me with healthy free time between tasks, allowing me to attend to my academic and professional pursuits. 
                    I did not, but I'm sure that if I pestered my supervisor for more work, he would comply.

            I offer my sincere gratitude to everyone involved in the program.       
        </p>
        <p>
            I also want to thank my supervisor, Bogdan, for supporting me and giving me tasks whenever he could. 
            I apologize for not reaching out to you more often.
